# Matplotlib for Python Developers - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Matplotlib for Python Developers - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/matplotlib-python-developers-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788625173), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book is a useful resource to perform data visualization with Python using the latest version of Matplotlib (2.1.x). You will create a variety of graphs and charts, and embed your plots within different third party tools. By the end of the book, you will build attractive, insightful and powerful visualizations to make better sense of your data.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

All the chapters have code files in their respective folders with the data files as needed.
Codes from chapter 5 and 6 may crash your Jupyter kernel, if that's the case, copy paste the code from the Jupyter cell to a .py file and run it via the Command Prompt/Terminal.
The extra_ch9 folder contains the GIF and video file outputs from chapter 9.

The code will look like the following:
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(4,4))
x = [0.1,0.3]
plt.pie(x)
plt.show()
```

A working installation of Python 3.4 or later is required. The default Python distribution can be obtained from https://www.python.org/download/. The installation of packages is covered in the chapters, but you can refer to the official documentation pages for more details. A Windows 7+, macOS 10.10+, or Linux-based computer with 4 GB RAM or above is recommended.
